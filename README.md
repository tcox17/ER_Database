# Emergency Room Database Design and Management

This project is an introduction to database creation, design, and management in SQL. This code will create a database with the following entity relationship diagram. This database is for an Emergency Room in a hospital for a patient visit (clinical care) including provider, treatment, procedures, and patient information. Separately, there are tables for user information and privileges, bed availability, and inventory of supplies.
