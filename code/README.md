## All Code Files for Recreating a Database System in SQL

The following files contain information to recreate an emergency room database as well as tables, views, stored procedures, and triggers. The files include:

1. *Database_Creation.sql*

    This code creates the database with all tables and created all references and foreign keys to create the system. This database follows the entity relationship diagram on the main README.
  
3. *Inserting_Data.sql*

    This code is used to enter random data into the system. Data is inserted into all tables after created.
  
5. *Queries.sql*

    This code shows basic queries in SQL. Some queries that were run included:
    -	Using aggregate functions to display data information
    -	Updating data in the tables
    -	Returning data from multiple tables using joins
  
7. *Advanced_Queries.sql*

    The Advanced Queries code displays more queries that dive deeper into SQL. The queries run include:
    -	Creating and granting user privileges
    -	An audit trail with triggers for updating, deleting, and inserting on tables
    -	Indexes
    -	Views
    -	Stored Procedures
  
9. *Checking_Triggers.sql*

    This code runs queries to ensure that all data above runs correctly.
